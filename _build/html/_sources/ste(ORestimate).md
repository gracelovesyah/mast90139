## standard error for odds ratio estimate 

Based on the provided output from the logistic regression model, the 'age' variable has a coefficient estimate of -0.11338. This is the estimated change in the log-odds of the outcome (wheezing) for each one-year increase in age.

To calculate the odds ratio for a one-year increase in age, we take the exponent of the coefficient estimate.

In R, we'd do this as:

R
Copy code
OR_age = exp(-0.11338)  # Output will be the odds ratio
The odds ratio represents the multiplicative change in the odds of the outcome for each one-unit increase in the predictor. In this case, it's the change in odds of wheezing for each one-year increase in age. If the OR is less than 1, this means that the odds of wheezing decreases as age increases.

To calculate the standard error of the log-odds ratio, you use the standard error given in your output (0.04386 for 'age'). However, if you want to approximate the standard error of the OR itself, you could multiply the OR by the standard error of the log-OR:

R
Copy code
SE_OR_age = OR_age * 0.04386  # Output will be the approximate standard error of the odds ratio
Remember that this is an approximation, and the true standard error of the OR may not be accurately represented by this calculation because of the asymmetry of the OR distribution. It's often more accurate to work with the standard error of the log-OR when creating confidence intervals or performing other statistical tests.

why do we multiply the OR by the standard error of the log-OR:

The reason for this approximation has to do with the properties of logarithms and exponential functions.

In a logistic regression model, the parameters we estimate are log-odds ratios. The standard error provided in the output of such a model is the standard error for the estimated log-odds ratio.

However, to interpret these coefficients more intuitively, we often exponentiate them to get odds ratios. The uncertainty of these odds ratio estimates (as represented by the standard error) also needs to be transformed appropriately.

Given that the transformation from a log-odds ratio to an odds ratio involves an exponential function (since OR = e^(log-OR)), the standard error of the log-odds ratio gets "stretched" when transformed to the scale of the odds ratio.

To approximate this transformed standard error, we can multiply the odds ratio by the standard error of the log-odds ratio.

However, this is just an approximation, and it doesn't always accurately capture the true standard error of the odds ratio, as the distribution of odds ratios can be skewed.

For accurate confidence intervals around the odds ratio, it is better to compute the confidence interval in the log-odds scale and then exponentiate the limits, because the log-odds scale is more symmetric and follows a normal distribution more closely.

So, while the multiplication is a quick and easy approximation, it's important to be aware of its limitations.
